    taking a chance, i opened my mouth, and let some of myself spill out. he was intrigued, it was novel to him, but you already understood. it was good to find someone who ticked my tiny boxes. we made the little in-jokes we knew we could share. the first and last time. i try to remember without melancholy, but i miss how we weren't able to be.

  2024-06-01 - stare / maps
  
    I walk in the street, alone,
    wind whipping my hems,
    sun pouring on my limbs.
    Opposite someone watches
    as I walk past,
    shock or glare,
    the stare.
    I transgress their boundaries
    of where all things must be:
    inherited maps,
    lines reinforced.
    Will is required to beat the stare,
    as are the basic needs of life:
    I will resist your attempts to territorialise me,
    for I roam my own lands
    on a map imprinted
    with joy.
    
  2024-05-17 - Letter to organisations about DfE RSHE consultation
  
    Hello,  

    I am writing to you because your organisation was listed as engaging with the UK Government during its last consultation into RSHE (relationships education, relationships and sex education, and health education) in England in 2018 [1]. You may have seen that the Government has now opened a new consultation to review the RSHE statutory guidance [2].  

    Unfortunately, the draft guidance imposes dangerous limits on what schools can teach. In particular, the guidance imposes age limits on when different topics can be taught, and forbids schools from teaching about gender. These limitations directly contradict evidence-informed international guidance on RSHE.  

    The draft guidance states that "sex education [...] should be taught no earlier than year 5" [2], by which time pupils will be aged 9-10. According to clarifying information in the separate consultation document, sex education "should be in line with what pupils learn about conception and birth as part of the national curriculum for science" [2]. The draft guidance also forbids teaching of gender and gender identity at any age, stating that "schools should not teach about the broader concept of gender identity. Gender identity is a highly contested and complex subject. [...] If asked about the topic of gender identity, schools should teach the facts about biological sex and not use any materials that present contested views as fact, including the view that gender is a spectrum." [2]  

    In contrast, evidence-informed guidance from the WHO [3] lists dozens of key learning objectives which would be unachievable under the draft guidance, either because they address an unapproved topic, or because they should be achieved before age 9, or both. Many of these are clearly uncontroversial and important, including:  
    - List differences in roles and responsibilities of men and women within the family (knowledge);  
    - Describe ways that these differences can affect what each can and cannot do (knowledge);  
    - Perceive that gender inequality impacts the roles and responsibilities within the family (attitudinal);  
    - Reflect on their own role and their feelings about men's and women’s roles and responsibilities within the family (skill)  
    - Recognize that gender, disability or someone’s health does not get in the way of becoming friends (attitudinal);  
    - Define gender and biological sex and describe how they are different (knowledge);  
    - Reflect on how they feel about their biological sex and gender (skill);  
    - Identify sources of information about sex and gender (knowledge);  
    - Acknowledge that perceptions about sex and gender are influenced by many different sources (attitudinal);  
    - Identify how people may be treated unfairly and unequally because of their gender (knowledge);  
    - Describe ways to make relationships between genders more fair and equal in their home, school and communities (knowledge);  
    - Recognize that unfair and unequal treatment of people of different genders is wrong and against their human rights (attitudinal);  
    - Recognize that it is important to respect the human rights of others, regardless of differences in gender (attitudinal).  
    - Acknowledge that gender roles can affect communication between people (attitudinal);  
    - Distinguish between the biological and social aspects of sex, gender and reproduction (knowledge);  
    - Compare and contrast ways that culture and religion influence how society views sex, gender and reproduction (knowledge);  
    - Recognise that puberty may be particularly challenging for some children, particularly those who are gender non-conforming, transgender or intersex (knowledge);  
    - Recall how gender inequality can contribute to girls’ feelings of shame and fear during menstruation (knowledge);  
    - Critically assess gendered standards of beauty that can drive people to want to change their appearance (knowledge);  
    - Analyze particular cultural and gender stereotypes and how they can affect people’s body image and their relationships (knowledge);  
    - Reflect on how gender norms and stereotypes influence people’s expectations and experience of sexual pleasure (knowledge);  
    - Explain that [...] people can plan when to get pregnant (knowledge)  
    - Discuss ways that gender roles and peer norms may influence contraceptive use (knowledge);  
    - Recognize that no sexually active young person should be refused access to contraceptives or condoms on the basis of their marital status, their sex or their gender (attitudinal);  

    The WHO guidance demonstrates that RSHE cannot be complete and effective without including content on gender, and teaching well beyond the national curriculum for science below age 9.  

    The current draft guidance harms children by restricting their access to the information and support they need to keep themselves and their peers safe. These restrictions will harm all children, but it will specifically disadvantage girls and LGBTQ+ children. We have already seen similar restrictions targeting LGBTQ+ children before, in the form of Section 28.  

    Section 28 was a section of the Local Government Act 1988, which prevented local authorities from "intentionally [promoting] homosexuality or [publishing] material with the intention of promoting homosexuality; and [promoting] the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship." [4]  

    Section 28 has been widely condemned by teachers, academics, politicians, and activists as a homophobic law which has caused significant harm to LGBTQ+ people. It created a vacuum of knowledge about gender and sexuality based on science and lived experience, leaving children to develop understandings of LGBTQ+ people and issues through stereotypes and rumours. Teachers could not answer pupil's questions through fear of being fired, and school libraries could not stock any material mentioning LGBTQ+ people or issues. Section 28 was finally repealed in England and Wales in 2003, but it is still affecting pupils today, with teachers who do not know what content they can teach in their classrooms [5], and school librarians who believe the legislation is still in force [6].  

    The website "Section 28 and its afterlives" [7] provides oral testimonies from teachers and former pupils about the way their lives were damaged by Section 28.  

    We cannot allow this to continue. We cannot allow any government to prioritise political manoeuvring over the wellbeing of any group of people.  

    I am writing to you to ask your organisation to make clear objections to paragraphs 45, 46, 58, 59, and 60 of the new draft RSHE guidance, should you be preparing a response to the consultation. Your organisation's input to this consultation is extremely valuable. I hope that through a unified effort, we can create positive change, and enable the Government to publish guidance which will enable schools to properly inform and support all pupils, without fear of legal challenges.  

    Within the consultation survey, I ask that you answer:  
    - "No" to question 22, "Do you agree with the proposed changes related to gender identity and gender reassignment in the guidance?";  
    - "No" to question 26, "Do you agree with the restriction on teaching sex education only in years 5 or 6?";  
    - "No" to questions 28 through 36, concerning age limits on various topics;  
    - "No" to question 38, "Do you agree with the age restriction on the secondary intimate and sexual relationships, including sexual health topic?"; and  
    - "No" to questions 40 through 43, concerning age limits on specific topics.  

    There are further questions which provide you with an opportunity to explain your answers. I have provided draft answers here, which you are free to use verbatim or revise as needed in your response:  

    For question 23, regarding materials on gender:  

    > The WHO's "International technical guidance on sexuality education" lists gender as a key concept which should be taught as part of a comprehensive RSHE education. It is not possible to fully discuss and understand sex, sexuality, and relationships without also considering gender and gender identity.  

    For question 27, 37, 39, and 44, regarding age limits on various topics:  

    > The WHO's "International technical guidance on sexuality education" lists many key learning objectives for these topics which involve gender, and which should be achieved below the age limits set by this guidance. These restrictions will prevent teachers from responding to the needs of the children under their care. Flexibility is not enough, there should be no national age restrictions or limitations on content.

    Thank you for taking the time to hear these concerns. I hope that the information provided here will be useful to you, and will enable those of us who value the wellbeing of all children to act in solidarity. Should you have any questions, or if you like any more information, I would be glad to hear from you and help however I can.  

    Sincerely,  
    Stella Aster

  2024-05-28 - warm eyes
  
    one day i want to see in the mirror
    eyes warm with fire
    ember coals inviting
    steam boiling off
    unquenchable
    flames dancing
    to lick our wounds
    and devour our enemies
    and fuse us together
  
  2024-05-06 - strength
  
    my friend tells me i am strong,
    that i do the things she cannot
    just by being myself
    unapologetically.
    but all i see are the things i cannot do,
    my own lapsed grace.

    the need for strength is infinite;
    in this world there is always another challenge.
    every time my soul lifts a weight,
    another stone is added.
    is my soul a muscle?
    will i grow stronger with each push?
    or will i hit my limit?
    how long can i continue
    until i am weakened beyond my ability
    to hold myself up?
