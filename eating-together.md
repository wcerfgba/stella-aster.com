# Eating Together: stories of communal food practices in England and Wales

* Potential collaborators
  * Lucy Aphramor

* Why "England and Wales?"
  * Because it is one of the three legal jurisdictions of the United Kingdom, and the one I am living in.
  * Important because law, policy, public services are all structured around and within boundaries like this one.
* Why food?
  * Food is a basic basic material need, it is a physical thing that all living beings require in order to stay alive.
  * Basic material needs are therefore a very important set of resources, and our approaches to what those needs are and how they are distributed define a range of political and economic positions.
  * My positions are: that it is possible to provide for everyone's basic material needs; that meeting everyone's needs is desirable, and provides a strong foundation for an effective and just society; that authority is incompatible with equality, and a just distribution of basic materials; that everyone's needs can be met through 'bottom up' approaches to organisation, management, democracy, ........ how to define anarchism again lol
  * I believe it's important for groups of people to be able to get together to eat, think, and talk about their food: where it comes from, how it's made, what it's made of. ... why?
* Aims of the publication
  * Evocative: stirs people to feel, think, act, ...
  * Practical: provides useful information to enable effective action
  * Documentary: recording things that are happening now to preserve the stories, knowledge, relationships, ... for the future
  * Speculative: imagining and desiring ways things can be different
  * Relational/Convivial: the process of building the publication should bring people together, forming and strengthening our relationships, increasing our capacities, and opening up potentials
* Format
  * A database of submissions from participants, and the network of relationships which emerges from that
  * Meetings and workshops among participants to discuss, share, and create submissions and responses
  * A multimedia hypertext publication of the database in Web and printed forms
    * Text, video, audio, photography, sculpture, dance, ... whatever contributors want to make
  * Workshop exhibitions to whoever is interested (local communities, members of the manager classes)
* Ideas for submissions
  * Interview people in Leyland, understand what they eat and paint a portrait together, get the discussion going locally
  * Document the food bank, the community lunch, the caf√©
  * The Pantry
  * McDonald's
  * Collect litter as data and see what pops out (geography, brands, times of day, ...)
    * Data collection at same time as environmental volunteering
* Bringing E&W back into it, using the particular geographic focus to understand it as a cohesive situation, exploring similarity and difference in situation, action, actuality, potentiality.
