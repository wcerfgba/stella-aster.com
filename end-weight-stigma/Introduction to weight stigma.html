<p>Weight stigma is the discrimination faced by people on the basis of
their weight. This is also referred to as sizeism, anti-fatness, and
anti-fat bias. <span class="citation"
data-cites="gordonImFatActivist2021">Aubrey Gordon (2021)</span> defines
it more precisely as “the attitudes, behaviors, and social systems that
specifically marginalize, exclude, underserve, and oppress fat
bodies.”</p>
<p>Readily accessible, documented accounts of weight stigma in health
services go back to at least 1983, when Doris K. shared some of her
experiences as a pregnant fat woman in the United States in the book
“Shadow on a Tightrope: Writings by Women on Fat Oppression”, edited by
<span class="citation"
data-cites="schoenfielderShadowTightropeWritings1983">Lisa Schoenfielder
and Barb Wieser (1983)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I was pregnant with my second child, I was about fifteen pounds
overweight by the charts. The doctor told me not to gain any weight with
this pregnancy, so that when I delivered, I wouldn’t have the weight
problem. So I tried to go along with it. I would starve myself for days,
knowing that I had to go to the doctor to weigh in. I can remember a few
days when I didn’t eat anything, or maybe just had a cup of coffee —
that’s no way for a pregnant mother to carry a child! But still I gained
five pounds. One day, after seeing that I had gained a few pounds, the
doctor blew up at me. He threw the chart down. He kept shaking his head
and telling me how disgusted he was with me. As he was cursing at me, I
sat there crying. The tears were running down my face. To hell with me,
I was nothing to him, I wasn’t a person, I was a big fat blob that
happened to be carrying a baby. He finally said, “I don’t give a damn
about you. But I do care about that baby. I’ll get rid of that
weight.”</p>
<p>So he put me in a hospital and on a very low calorie diet, about 700
calories per day. And after two or three days he came in to check on me,
and I hadn’t lost any weight. He said, “Who’s slipping you candy?” I
said, “Honest to God, I’m not cheating.” He said, “You have to be,
because you’re not losing.”</p>
<p>So he cut the diet down to 500 calories per day. And he had the
nurses watching me to make sure I didn’t cheat, as if I was such a mess
that I couldn’t even be trusted inside a hospital, let alone the real
world. And after a week I had lost one pound. And he looked at me and
said, “Well, you surprise me. I guess it is hard for you to lose weight,
isn’t it?” And I never saw him again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The doctor may have attacked Doris and refused to trust her due to
holding stigmatising beliefs and attitudes towards higher weight people.
<span class="citation" data-cites="linkConceptualizingStigma2001">Bruce
G. Link and Jo C. Phelan (2001)</span> describe stigma as a social
process where differences between people are labelled, where people are
associated with negative stereotypes, where people are separated into
“us” and “them”, and where people experience discrimination, and a loss
of social status. Doris’ attack is an instance of direct, individual
discrimination. However, there are many more processes through which
weight stigma exists and operates.</p>
<p><span class="citation"
data-cites="linkConceptualizingStigma2001">Bruce G. Link and Jo C.
Phelan (2001)</span> also observe that “all manner of disadvantage can
result from outside of a model in which one person does something bad to
another”. They give the examples of institutional racism, disabling
environments, and mental health stigma, to demonstrate how structural
discrimination, or structural stigma, occurs in specific groups. <span
class="citation"
data-cites="hatzenbuehlerIntroductionSpecialIssue2014">Mark L.
Hatzenbuehler and Bruce G. Link (2014)</span> define structural stigma
as “societal-level conditions, cultural norms, and institutional
policies that constrain the opportunities, resources, and wellbeing of
the stigmatized”.</p>
<p><span class="citation"
data-cites="orrTransFatAutoethnographic2022">Bek J. Orr (2022)</span>
shares one of their experiences of structural discrimination as a fat
trans non-binary person:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I sat on the narrow, paper-covered examination table, shirtless and
exposed to the nurse practitioner as she took my breast measurements and
brusquely asked me what my expectations were for breast reduction. For
months I had practiced this very conversation with my partner and alone,
yet I was still nervous and inarticulate. It was complicated. I fumbled
through a nervous over-explanation of my gender identity and surgical
outcome hopes. Without responding to my manic monologue, the nurse
practitioner said I would be a good candidate for surgery covered by
insurance. I felt the breath I didn’t know I was holding release and my
heart surge! Then came the however. “However, your BMI exceeds our
cutoff to proceed with surgery. Obesity is connected to surgical
complication, so we’ll need you to bring your BMI down below 30,
calculated to 40 pounds. You’ll need to lose 40 pounds and come back for
another consultation with the surgeon before we can move forward.” As I
walked out of the building I wondered out loud, “They’ve had all my
records including my BMI since I made the appointment months ago. Why
did they have me come and sit through the humiliation of that exam only
to tell me that I couldn’t see the surgeon and to come back 40 pounds
lighter? How quickly can I lose 40 pounds?” I felt deflated and
ashamed.</p>
<p>In the weeks that followed I actively avoided thinking about the
appointment, surgery that would not happen, the body that did not feel
like mine. I felt frozen with shame and disappointment. Months later,
when I was finally able to share my story with close friends, they
insisted, that I should write about this. Only then, with the distance
that academic research can provide, I started to outline what became
this article.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Bek’s case, they were refused care on the basis of a BMI cutoff
policy, which presumably has been created because of perceived medical
and medico-legal risks around surgeries for higher weight patients.</p>
<p>This is an example of a particular form of stigma called
pathologisation, which <span class="citation"
data-cites="foxWorkingEradicatingWeight2023">Rachel Fox and others
(2023)</span> describe as a social process through which people are
diagnosed with an illness, dehumanised by being understood through their
illness, and then subjected to intervention in order to cure their
illness. Doris also experienced pathologisation, as her doctor seemed to
be concerned with the effect of her weight on the safety of her child;
he attempted to reduce her weight through medical interventions; he
attacked her after getting to a point where he no longer cared for her
wellbeing; and he was unwilling or unable to trust Doris’ knowledge of
her own body.</p>
<p>Pathologisation also manifests in the way Bek and Doris both describe
experiences of shame and disconnection from their bodies. These feelings
are connected to what is commonly called internalised stigma, and which
<span class="citation" data-cites="linkConceptualizingStigma2001">Bruce
G. Link and Jo C. Phelan (2001)</span> refer to as the “social
psychological processes operating through the stigmatized person”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The person may wonder, “Will others look down on me, reject me,
simply because I have been identified as having a mental illness?” Then
to the extent that it becomes a part of a person’s world view, that
perception can have serious negative consequences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the case of Bek and Doris’, both of them were apprehensive ahead
of their appointments, and both showed an experience of psychological
trauma which affected their self-worth and required time to recover
from.</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows how these different forms of stigma manifest within
Bek and Doris’ accounts. We represent part of each account as a card
with a sequence of events running left to right. Above and below each
card, we place events or processes which might influence, or be
influenced by, the events in the account, so that time also runs
‘through’ the account from top to bottom. Doris talks about her fear of
the weigh-in, and Bek mentions practicing their conversation with their
partner. These behaviours may be indicative of prior negative
experiences, and can be understood as examples of healthcare avoidance
or hesitation. During their appointments, they each experience either
interpersonal or structural stigma. These are themselves a result of
pathologisation, as both Doris’ doctor and Bek’s nurse practicioner are
constructing their weight as a risk factor which needs to be forcibly
modified. All of this leads to strong negative emotions which can linger
as internalised stigma. This internalisation may reinforce the existing
disposition to healthcare avoidance and ultimately worsen health
inequalities. In other words, if going to the doctor harms you,
eventually you will stop going to the doctor.</p>

Bek's accounts as a series of events, each of which may be influenced by

</figure>
<p>Doris and Bek’s accounts show just some of the ways that different
forms of weight stigma and other harmful social processes like
healthcare avoidance can drive each other. These understandings about
how weight stigma operates make it easier for us to see what things need
to change, and where we can act to heal from, dismantle, and prevent
weight stigma. In Bek’s case, we should ask why and how the BMI cutoff
was implemented, so that we can understand how to remove that barrier
from the surgery process. In Doris’ case, we should ask why the doctor
was so concerned about her weight in relation to her pregnancy, and how
he got to a point where he attacked his patient. In both cases, we
should ask what people need to heal from traumatic experiences, to
prevent them lingering and contributing to internalised stigma, and we
should ask what we need to handle the things which lead to us avoiding
accessing healthcare.</p>
<p>Activists and researchers continue to put a huge amount of effort
into challenging weight stigma, as shown by the huge increase in
academic publications about weight stigma over time. As of 12th February
2025, a search on Google Scholar for
<code>("weight stigma" OR "sizeism" OR "fat bias" OR "weight bias" OR "fatphobia")</code>
yields “about 21,600 results”, with “about 17,400” of these in the last
10 years. Repeating this search on Google reveals that these academic
publications form the majority of the results that people see when
looking for information about, and accounts of people’s experiences of,
weight stigma. We will discuss some of this work in a later article,
“Existing interventions for challenging weight stigma”.</p>
<p>The aim of the Central Lancashire End Weight Stigma project is to
enable us, the people of Central Lancashire, to heal from, dismantle,
and prevent weight stigma in our local healthcare system. To learn more
