<p><small>Last updated: 12th February 2025</small></p>
<p>Weight stigma is the discrimination faced by people on the basis of
their weight. This is also referred to as sizeism, anti-fatness, and
anti-fat bias. <span class="citation"
data-cites="gordonImFatActivist2021">Aubrey Gordon (2021)</span> defines
it more precisely as ‚Äúthe attitudes, behaviors, and social systems that
specifically marginalize, exclude, underserve, and oppress fat bodies.‚Äù
For more information about weight stigma, including some people‚Äôs
experiences of weight stigma in healthcare, please read our <a
href="Introduction to weight stigma" title="wikilink">Introduction to
weight stigma</a>.</p>
The aim of the Central Lancashire End Weight Stigma project is to enable
us, the people of Central Lancashire, to heal from, dismantle, and
prevent weight stigma in our local healthcare system.

<p>My name is Stella Aster. I‚Äôve lived in Leyland, Central Lancashire
for over 20 years, and I‚Äôm a PhD student at Leeds Beckett University. I
am the founder and current caretaker of the Central Lancashire End
Weight Stigma project üòä I started this project because I believe
everyone deserves the opportunity of happy and healthy life, and I want
to understand and dismantle health discrimination in all its forms.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="our-approach">Our approach</h2>
<p>We want to talk to people in Central Lancashire who have experienced
weight stigma, about their experiences with health services, and bring
them together to share their experiences with each other. If you would
like to share your experiences and connect with others, please email
Stella at <a href="mailto:endweightstigma@stella-aster.com"
class="email">endweightstigma@stella-aster.com</a>.</p>
<p>We are committed to being led by people in Central Lancashire with
lived experiences of weight stigma. If you would like to be involved in
our work, or if you have other ideas for how we can heal from,
dismantle, and prevent weight stigma in our home, please email Stella at
<a href="mailto:endweightstigma@stella-aster.com"
class="email">endweightstigma@stella-aster.com</a>.</p>
<p>We are working on plans for a local, public research project which
will allow us to get a better understanding of weight stigma in Central
Lancashire. We will be publishing more information about this soon, in a
separate article on ‚ÄúLocal research‚Äù.</p>
<h2 id="get-involved">Get involved</h2>
<p>If you have any questions or would like to get involved with or
contribute to the project, please contact Stella Aster at <a
href="mailto:endweightstigma@stella-aster.com"
class="email">endweightstigma@stella-aster.com</a>. We are particularly
interested in hearing directly from people with lived experiences of
weight stigma.</p>
