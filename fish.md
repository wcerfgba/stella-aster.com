this will be a net: a loose structure of words arranged along lines, intersecting on the page.

first step is to collect words and phrases and fragments which we can stitch together. second stage is to assemble them into a grid.



between trees
sparkling like
diamonds
a pool of light
drawn in
i walk closer
under the water
there are fish!
gently smoothly
flowing by and through
dirt on the bottom
but the water is clear
tinted greeny-brown
the wind blows ripples
diamonds surf on the waves
as the fish move
underneath the glass
inside the glass
small fish
splotchy coloured little fish
tiny scales
waving along
through the pond

trimethylamine
the smell of fish
always a smell
before you get there
to the fishmongers
appetizing and sickening
intense
gutted corpses
cold scales
red and pink and yellow insides
the slit in the belly

building a structure out of pre-specified phrases is difficult. perhaps we can specify a structure first and then write a poem like a crossword. but that feels a bit lifeless. i'd like something where the structure is an emergence of the words and their images. perhaps it requires assembling in smaller pieces, moving back and forth.
