between trees sparkling like diamonds a pool of light. drawn in, i walk closer, under the water there are fish! gently smoothly flowing by and through. dirt on the bottom but the water is clear, tinded greeny-brown. the wind blows ripples, diamonds surf on the waves as the fish move underneath the glass, inside the glass. small fish, splotchy coloured little fish, tiny scales, waving along through the pond.

trimethylamine, the smell of fish. always a smell before you get there, to the fishmongers. appetizing and sickening, intense.
