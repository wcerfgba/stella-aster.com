What am I supposed to do,
when I am waiting on someone who
needs to sign-off on my care?
How am I supposed to live,
while I wait for someone to give
me air?

I wake up and don't want
to get out of bed,
overwhelmed by the lists in my head,
tasks crash like waves pulling
my motivation from under me.

But if I don't do it, who will?
I feel angry, stressed that I'm stressed
when it would be so easy
for you to prescribe
and calm the waves inside.
Do your fucking job,
'cos I shouldn't have to!

We can only hold our breath so long,
until the oxygen is gone
and desparation takes hold.
