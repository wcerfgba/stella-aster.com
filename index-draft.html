      <h1>Stella Aster</h1>

      <img class="me" src="me.jpg" alt="A photo of Stella, smiling.">

      <p>I'm a social researcher and activist living in Leyland, Lancashire. I use my tech, research, and people skills to help local communities to understand and solve their problems.</p>

      <h2>What I'm doing</h2>

      <p>I'm a Patient Representative at Worden Medical Centre. I analyse patient feedback, take minutes in meetings, and help organise the patient newsletter.</p>

      <p>I am a member of the Bookings Team at St Mary's Community Centre. I handle booking confirmations, help with tech issues, and am redesigning how we handle all of the information and enquiries.</p>

      <p>I'm a PhD student, and my research aims to help higher weight patients and NHS staff in Blackpool to better meet their healthcare needs.</p>

      <p>I am a volunteer at Radio Leyland. I built and maintain their What's On events listings page, and help out with tech issues.</p>

      <p>I am forming the Leyland Trans Patient Support Group.</p>

      <!-- ETitC -->

      <!-- NK? JDL? Navvies' Barge? -->

      <p>In the past I have been a member of Food Not Bombs Southampton. We accepted ingredients from local shops and cooked them into delicious vegan meals, which we served for free on the street as a demonstration against war.</p>

      <h2>Work with me</h2>

      <p>I have a wide range of tech and research skills. I can build websites, redesign processes and systems, carry out surveys, facilitate meetings and workshops, and conduct interviews. I'm also patient, kind, and a good listener and communicator.</p>

      <p>I know that not everyone has the same skills as me. ....</p>

      <h2>Sponsor me</h2>

      <p>If you would like to support me financially, so that I can continue working with local communities and small, voluntary organisations, you can donate via the PayPal links below, or email me at <a href="mailto:hello@stella-aster.com">hello@stella-aster.com</a>.
