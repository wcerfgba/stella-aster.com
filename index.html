I am stellar, I am stardust.
My bones are made of the same space-time-matter-energy as the earth and the sun.
I am the universe folding inwards, breaking
apart and meeting itself in order to
become
more than the
everything it already
is.

I am nexus, a situation: a place where times and spaces meet and intertwine.
"The relation is the smallest unit of analysis",
individuals are intersections of relations are intersections of individuals.

I am multiple, faceted, fractal. I am more than I can ever be at once.
There is always another story, no total or universal.
I seek the rainforest valley,
   not the desert plain;
a place where all things can coexist within and across their difference.

I am machine, assemblage.
I am action
without essence,
 always becoming,
"populated by multiplicities" of the actual and potential.

I am scholar, researcher. I live, I think, I talk, I listen, I write.
I hold up prisms to diffract myself and my surroundings.
I work beyond disciplines, I gather beads and threads.

I am anarchist. I am an ant in the Myrmecodia,
feeding the plant as it
shelters me from harm,
mutually entangled in relations of care. Authority is
 the suppression and rejection of multiplicity,
both undesirable and unworkable. I reject authority.
