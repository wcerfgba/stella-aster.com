  End Weight Stigma Blackpool
  
    For my PhD research, I am convening a group of higher weight people in Blackpool to work towards dismantling weight stigma and creating more accessible and compassionate healthcare in the area. I'm thin, and my involvement in the project explores and challenges the position of the 'outsider' at the intersections of art, research, and activism.
    We are currently developing a website with more information.
    
    

  Sincerity
  
    A deep way of being, innate, fluid, natural, effortless, wild.
    Tinges of essentialism, can they be washed away?
    An exploration of a core value, the implications of a freedom for us to be... ourselves?
    Sincerity is a concept, emotion, and experience I've been sitting with for a few months now. It connects to something very deep within me. I'm currently developing my practice to focus on exploring, sharing, and creating sincerity.

  2024-07-19 - Poem for the Tap
  
  I wrote this for my pub, the pub where I spend most of my pub time. We have a nice community and I've made good friends there.
  
  ---
  
  our bar is a tapestry,
  drawn by a hundred hands
  from conversations that
  bubbled over the glasses.
  communed in curious crafts,
  an open community
  bonded by beer 
  which brewed
  mutual sincerities.

  we are nodding dog friendly:
  a place for everyone to boogie or bark.
  wear hi vis and head scarves
  or flat caps and Tintin t-shirts;
  just don't forget your beer tokens 😉

  currant events and barricades
  make me ask, where is my mind?
  here, we find
  sunshine on a rainy day;
  here, electricities flicker
  and laughter bounces
  off chipboard panels,
  and steam pours
  from the glasswash.

  2024-06-01 - Stare / Maps
  
    I walk in the street, alone,
    wind whipping my hems,
    sun pouring on my limbs.
    Opposite someone watches
    as I walk past,
    shock or glare,
    the stare.
    I transgress their boundaries
    of where all things must be:
    inherited maps,
    lines reinforced.
    Will is required to beat the stare,
    as are the basic needs of life:
    I will resist your attempts to territorialise me,
    for I roam my own lands
    on a map imprinted
    with joy.
    
    
    
  2024-05-17 - Letter to organisations about DfE RSHE consultation
  
    I wrote and sent this letter out over several weeks in May to nearly 80 organisations, as part of an effort to generate a campaign for better sex education in schools.
    
    ---
  
    Hello,  

    I am writing to you because your organisation was listed as engaging with the UK Government during its last consultation into RSHE (relationships education, relationships and sex education, and health education) in England in 2018 [1]. You may have seen that the Government has now opened a new consultation to review the RSHE statutory guidance [2].  

    Unfortunately, the draft guidance imposes dangerous limits on what schools can teach. In particular, the guidance imposes age limits on when different topics can be taught, and forbids schools from teaching about gender. These limitations directly contradict evidence-informed international guidance on RSHE.  

    The draft guidance states that "sex education [...] should be taught no earlier than year 5" [2], by which time pupils will be aged 9-10. According to clarifying information in the separate consultation document, sex education "should be in line with what pupils learn about conception and birth as part of the national curriculum for science" [2]. The draft guidance also forbids teaching of gender and gender identity at any age, stating that "schools should not teach about the broader concept of gender identity. Gender identity is a highly contested and complex subject. [...] If asked about the topic of gender identity, schools should teach the facts about biological sex and not use any materials that present contested views as fact, including the view that gender is a spectrum." [2]  

    In contrast, evidence-informed guidance from the WHO [3] lists dozens of key learning objectives which would be unachievable under the draft guidance, either because they address an unapproved topic, or because they should be achieved before age 9, or both. Many of these are clearly uncontroversial and important, including:  
    - List differences in roles and responsibilities of men and women within the family (knowledge);  
    - Describe ways that these differences can affect what each can and cannot do (knowledge);  
    - Perceive that gender inequality impacts the roles and responsibilities within the family (attitudinal);  
    - Reflect on their own role and their feelings about men's and women’s roles and responsibilities within the family (skill)  
    - Recognize that gender, disability or someone’s health does not get in the way of becoming friends (attitudinal);  
    - Define gender and biological sex and describe how they are different (knowledge);  
    - Reflect on how they feel about their biological sex and gender (skill);  
    - Identify sources of information about sex and gender (knowledge);  
    - Acknowledge that perceptions about sex and gender are influenced by many different sources (attitudinal);  
    - Identify how people may be treated unfairly and unequally because of their gender (knowledge);  
    - Describe ways to make relationships between genders more fair and equal in their home, school and communities (knowledge);  
    - Recognize that unfair and unequal treatment of people of different genders is wrong and against their human rights (attitudinal);  
    - Recognize that it is important to respect the human rights of others, regardless of differences in gender (attitudinal).  
    - Acknowledge that gender roles can affect communication between people (attitudinal);  
    - Distinguish between the biological and social aspects of sex, gender and reproduction (knowledge);  
    - Compare and contrast ways that culture and religion influence how society views sex, gender and reproduction (knowledge);  
    - Recognise that puberty may be particularly challenging for some children, particularly those who are gender non-conforming, transgender or intersex (knowledge);  
    - Recall how gender inequality can contribute to girls’ feelings of shame and fear during menstruation (knowledge);  
    - Critically assess gendered standards of beauty that can drive people to want to change their appearance (knowledge);  
    - Analyze particular cultural and gender stereotypes and how they can affect people’s body image and their relationships (knowledge);  
    - Reflect on how gender norms and stereotypes influence people’s expectations and experience of sexual pleasure (knowledge);  
    - Explain that [...] people can plan when to get pregnant (knowledge)  
    - Discuss ways that gender roles and peer norms may influence contraceptive use (knowledge);  
    - Recognize that no sexually active young person should be refused access to contraceptives or condoms on the basis of their marital status, their sex or their gender (attitudinal);  

    The WHO guidance demonstrates that RSHE cannot be complete and effective without including content on gender, and teaching well beyond the national curriculum for science below age 9.  

    The current draft guidance harms children by restricting their access to the information and support they need to keep themselves and their peers safe. These restrictions will harm all children, but it will specifically disadvantage girls and LGBTQ+ children. We have already seen similar restrictions targeting LGBTQ+ children before, in the form of Section 28.  

    Section 28 was a section of the Local Government Act 1988, which prevented local authorities from "intentionally [promoting] homosexuality or [publishing] material with the intention of promoting homosexuality; and [promoting] the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship." [4]  

    Section 28 has been widely condemned by teachers, academics, politicians, and activists as a homophobic law which has caused significant harm to LGBTQ+ people. It created a vacuum of knowledge about gender and sexuality based on science and lived experience, leaving children to develop understandings of LGBTQ+ people and issues through stereotypes and rumours. Teachers could not answer pupil's questions through fear of being fired, and school libraries could not stock any material mentioning LGBTQ+ people or issues. Section 28 was finally repealed in England and Wales in 2003, but it is still affecting pupils today, with teachers who do not know what content they can teach in their classrooms [5], and school librarians who believe the legislation is still in force [6].  

    The website "Section 28 and its afterlives" [7] provides oral testimonies from teachers and former pupils about the way their lives were damaged by Section 28.  

    We cannot allow this to continue. We cannot allow any government to prioritise political manoeuvring over the wellbeing of any group of people.  

    I am writing to you to ask your organisation to make clear objections to paragraphs 45, 46, 58, 59, and 60 of the new draft RSHE guidance, should you be preparing a response to the consultation. Your organisation's input to this consultation is extremely valuable. I hope that through a unified effort, we can create positive change, and enable the Government to publish guidance which will enable schools to properly inform and support all pupils, without fear of legal challenges.  

    Within the consultation survey, I ask that you answer:  
    - "No" to question 22, "Do you agree with the proposed changes related to gender identity and gender reassignment in the guidance?";  
    - "No" to question 26, "Do you agree with the restriction on teaching sex education only in years 5 or 6?";  
    - "No" to questions 28 through 36, concerning age limits on various topics;  
    - "No" to question 38, "Do you agree with the age restriction on the secondary intimate and sexual relationships, including sexual health topic?"; and  
    - "No" to questions 40 through 43, concerning age limits on specific topics.  

    There are further questions which provide you with an opportunity to explain your answers. I have provided draft answers here, which you are free to use verbatim or revise as needed in your response:  

    For question 23, regarding materials on gender:  

    > The WHO's "International technical guidance on sexuality education" lists gender as a key concept which should be taught as part of a comprehensive RSHE education. It is not possible to fully discuss and understand sex, sexuality, and relationships without also considering gender and gender identity.  

    For question 27, 37, 39, and 44, regarding age limits on various topics:  

    > The WHO's "International technical guidance on sexuality education" lists many key learning objectives for these topics which involve gender, and which should be achieved below the age limits set by this guidance. These restrictions will prevent teachers from responding to the needs of the children under their care. Flexibility is not enough, there should be no national age restrictions or limitations on content.

    Thank you for taking the time to hear these concerns. I hope that the information provided here will be useful to you, and will enable those of us who value the wellbeing of all children to act in solidarity. Should you have any questions, or if you like any more information, I would be glad to hear from you and help however I can.  

    Sincerely,  
    Stella Aster

  2024-05-28 - warm eyes
  
    one day i want to see in the mirror
    eyes warm with fire
    ember coals inviting
    steam boiling off
    unquenchable
    flames dancing
    to lick our wounds
    and devour our enemies
    and fuse us together
  
  
  
  2024-05-06 - strength
  
    my friend tells me i am strong,
    that i do the things she cannot
    just by being myself
    unapologetically.
    but all i see are the things i cannot do,
    my own lapsed grace.

    the need for strength is infinite;
    in this world there is always another challenge.
    every time my soul lifts a weight,
    another stone is added.
    is my soul a muscle?
    will i grow stronger with each push?
    or will i hit my limit?
    how long can i continue
    until i am weakened beyond my ability
    to hold myself up?

    You’re not going to like what I’m about to say. You won’t like it because I’ll tell you that we already know the solution to our problems, and that it will require us to experiment with and do things we’ve never done before. You won’t like it, because I’ll tell you that it’s easy, so easy that in many ways we’re already doing it, and that pulling it off will require overcoming some of the greatest struggles we have ever known. Simply put, we have an inability to deal with change and variety.

    Argentina is a country in South America. In the west are the Valdivian Temperate Forests, and in the east is the Patagonian Desert. Along the north east you will find the tail of the Andes Mountains, and in the very south is the Perito Moreno Glacier. You ask how we can get Britain moving again? We need to start adapting to our environment. How do you get from the glacier, to the forests, to the mountains? You cannot do it without changing your mode of transport.

    We practice adaptation all the time in our daily lives. If the soup’s not right, we add a little salt. If the café is closed, we find another one. But when it comes to the NHS, the economy, or the justice system, we seem to be repeating the same mistakes, expecting the dune buggy to take us smoothly up the mountain, trekking through the forest on skis. The word “institution” conjures up images of large buildings with marble pillars, which have stood unchanged for aeons. We have tried to be rigid, to stand firm in the face of change, but it does not work. Instead we must be malleable, so we can adapt.

    In his 2008 book, “Systems Thinking in the Public Sector”, John Seddon explains how the top-down design of public services, and an obsession with targets, homogenises the needs of service users, prevents systems from absorbing and managing variety, and ultimately leads to increased demand and ineffective services. In a little over 200 pages, he deconstructs a decade of failed reforms to policing, trading standards, and housing benefit, and provides a different paradigm and different tools to enable us to re-envision our public services. Sixteen years on, he continues to fight against what he calls “command and control ideology”, yet the failed approach of top-down design remains prevalent throughout the public sector.

    The Covid-19 pandemic threw the inequalities in our country and the failures of our public services into sharp relief. But it also showed how local communities were able to self-organise and provide mutual aid in the absence of central planning and government support. Rhiannon Firth’s 2022 book, “Disaster Anarchy”, documents the mutual aid efforts that arose in response to both Hurricane Katrina and the Covid-19 pandemic, and demonstrates that even in the most dire of circumstances, communities will come together to meet their collective needs.

    The answer to our problems does not lie in a better proposal for our decision-makers, because decision-makers are a structural component of the problem. Policy is a structural component of the problem. Government is a structural component of the problem. Institutions are a structural component of the problem. Any attempt to solve our problems from above will only serve to further evaporate agency and capability from the individuals and communities who face these problems on a daily basis. We don’t need ‘better’ decisions, we need to change who is making the decisions. We need to give people control of their own lives.

    Adaptation is a fundamental behaviour of all life. It is something we are all capable of, in various degrees, as individuals and as collectives. But like any muscle, it will wither if it is not exercised, and it is hard to exercise when you are being forcibly restrained by someone else. This is the great struggle I alluded to before. We need our decision-makers to do less, not more. We need them to stop restraining us and start empowering us, giving us the tools we need to look after ourselves and trusting us to do exactly that. If you want to get Britain moving again, you need to find ways to enable people to work on improving their communities, learn new skills, do community organising and research, provide education and care for the people around them, and spend their time on the things that are important to them. The two greatest constraints on that are time and money. We need enough money to meet our basic material needs, and we need enough time to think about and work on the problems that we see around us in our own lives, our families, our communities. 

    If you want practical suggestions to get Britain moving again, and you want to give people more time and money, consider:
      - Implementing a Universal Basic Income at or above the Real Living Wage.
      - Mandating a three day working week, with a corresponding increase in the Minimum Wage.
      - Providing funding for worker-owned co-operative businesses, along with training in worker ownership and self-management.

    Let go of the handbrake, we can drive the car ourselves.

  2023-06-01 - Jacob's Join at The Golden Tap
  
    "Jacob's join" is a term used in some places in Lancashire and Yorkshire to refer to a potluck, or an event where several people bring food to share. I organised one at my local pub. I started by asking a few people if they'd be up for it, because there's no point organising something if nobody will show up. I got their contact details and worked out a time and date that would work for most people. I also printed a poster with my contact details, and later updated this with the agreed date and time. A box of reusable plates and cutlery was purchased from Amazon. On the day, I greeted people and labelled their dishes. I asked about dietary suitability and allergens, and wrote that on the labels. Everyone had a great time sharing food, conversation, and drinks together, and learning new flavours and recipes 😋 Is that art, research, or activism?

      <p>This website, <em>the-light-of-the.world</em>, serves as a humanist interpretation of this passage, by using the computer display as a lamp.

      <p>The website is set up so that it will reach full brightness at 8 billion visitors, and the United Nations projects that the world human population will reach 8 billion people around the year 2021 [1]. However, the International Telecommunication Union estimates that since the end of 2018 only 3.9 billion people have access to the Internet [2]. In this respect, <em>the-light-of-the.world</em> is both aspirational and critical. Fully lighting the lamp is a concrete goal and the product of significant collective action, but it is not possible until we close the digital divide.</p>

  2018-05-18 - I CAN FEEL
  
    Exhibited at the Harris Open 2021.
    
    This software art piece is composed of a 13 x 13 grid of squares, each of which changes between black and white at a set rate. The frequency of each oscillator is chosen such that the grid will eventually produce every 13 x 13 black and white picture, before looping. This takes approximately 10<sup>409</sup> years.
    The initial state of the oscillators has been chosen such that after approximately 60 seconds, the eponymous phrase I CAN FEEL appears in the image.
    I CAN FEEL invites us to observe the chaotic output of a mathematical system and find something meaningful. A set of lights becomes a writing system, a phrase, an emotional self-recognition.
    This meaningful image is just one shard in a vast library of meaningless arrangements of squares. As we continue to watch the piece, we can recognise smaller patterns in the pixels. One might consider what shapes our concept of ‘meaning’ to be so specific.
    It is important to consider that the system of oscillators is not aware of its own arrangement: if we rearranged the squares into a line or circle, each square would continue to change at the same rate, and the eponymous pattern would not appear. This raises questions around machine sentience: if a machine is sentient but not aware of how it is structured and perceived by human operators, how could it signal its sentience to us?
