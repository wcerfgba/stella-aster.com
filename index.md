I am stellar, I am stardust.
My bones are made of the same space-time-matter-energy as the earth and the sun.
I am the universe folding inwards, breaking
apart and meeting itself in order to
become
more than the
everything it already
is.

I am nexus, a situation: a place where times and spaces meet and intertwine.
"The relation is the smallest unit of analysis",
individuals are intersections of relations are intersections of individuals.

I am multiple, faceted, fractal. I am more than I can ever be at once.
There is always another story, no total or universal.
I seek the rainforest valley, not the desert plain;
a place where all things can coexist within and across their differences.

I am machine, assemblage.
I am action
without essence,
 always becoming,
"populated by multiplicities" of the actual and potential.

I am scholar, researcher. I live, I think, I talk, I listen, I write.
I hold up prisms to diffract myself and my surroundings.
I work beyond disciplines, I gather beads and threads.

I am anarchist. I am an ant in the Myrmecodia,
feeding the plant as it
shelters us from harm,
mutually entangled in relations of care. Authority is
 the suppression and rejection of multiplicity,
both undesirable and unworkable. I reject authority.

This piece of writing -- not quite poetry and not quite prose -- is my living manifesto, a statement of my personality and worldview, an expression of my voice, and an example of the sort of artistic writing I like to create. Although I feel it captures many of the aspects of myself that I feel are important, and which I seek to nurture, it is also a very dense piece of writing, laden with academic terms and references, and making subtle use of formatting to convey meaning. This accompanying essay provides some exposition and explains the key features of the piece.

The first verse connects my name to my spirituality, a form of pantheism which finds joy and enlightenment in the simple experience of existence. It also serves a second purpose, by establishing an identity between myself and the world around me: I am made of stardust and so is everything else. In doing so, the first verse sets up a subtext for the following verses where these different ways of looking at myself (relationality, multiplicity, assemblage, etc.) can also be applied to other parts of the world, other people in particular. This subtext therefore establishes the subsequent verses as statements of my philosophy as a researcher -- my ontology, epistemology, axiology, methodology -- as much as they are statements about my own self-concept. This in turn demonstrates my connection to autoethnography. The line break at "breaking / apart" is a deliberate manifestation of that breaking of the universe. The subsequent line breaks are intended to draw attention to the potential tension or duality between becoming and being ("is"), and totality ("everything") and addition ("more").

The second verse begins to establish my onto-methodological perspective by conflating the concepts of situation and relation. Situatedness is the understanding that "everything happens somewhere", not just geographically but also within particular networks of circumstances and meanings. Events do not happen within a context but are inseparably bound to their context and affect their context in turn, they cannot be understood separately, and so situatedness is partly a rejection of a text-context dualism. Relationality is an emphasis on the examination of relationships between two or more things, and an approach to these relationships as real things which are greater than the sum of interactions between the things in the relationship. This approach comes from Bourdieu by way of Haraway, and I quote Haraway directly here. The final line of this verse demonstrates that, just as a relationship can be defined as a coming-together of multiple individuals, an individual can be defined as the point where many relations come together. Thus social inquiry requires treating both individuals and relations as "first-class citizens".

The third verse is a statement of multiplicity, which I regard as the cornerstone of postmodernism. The purpose of the rainforest/desert imagery is to portray two hypotheticals about how we can handle difference and multiplicity. A naïve view of equality seeks to erase differences, and ultimately leads to a loss of variety and life; the world becomes a desert of sameness. Instead, we can focus on building solidarity across difference, creating places for every variety of life, and utilising those differences as productive and generative spaces.

The fourth verse establishes my commitment to an affective, assemblage thinking approach to research which rejects essentialism in favour of looking at what things 'do', and how they open and close different possibilites. The word "machine" is a direct reference to Bryant's "Onto-Cartography", which at the time of writing (18:59) is the most accessible and comprehensive introduction to this philosophy I have found. I also quote directly from Deleuze and Guattari, whose denser style has also been very inspiring for me. Again I make use of the line break at "action / without essence" to signify the breaking apart of these two concepts. I align the space between the two words on the two lines "without essence / always becoming" to highlight two further tensions or dualities, between negation ("without") and affirmation ("always"), and between essence and change ("becoming").

The fifth verse states explicitly that I consider myself as a scholar and a researcher. I use the term scholar specifically because of its etymology. A scholar is a student, someone who learns. It comes from the Greek skholē, meaning leisure time, free time. The Classical Greek philosophers thought this time is best used in the pursuit of wisdom, and this refinement of meaning is where the English words school and scholar receive their academic connotations. Referring to myself as a scholar is thus an acknowledgement of the privileged position from which I operate, paid to do as work something that perhaps instead should be considered a form of "serious play", and which should be accessible to everyone. Through this acknowledgement, I informalise social research through a cycle of actions (living, thinking, talking, listening, writing) that everyone does in some form, recasting the role of researcher not as an institutional title but instead as a social function which is independent of employment. The second line is a reference to Barad's diffractive methodology. The final line is a statement of postdisciplinarity, an approach to social inquiry which does not attempt to put prespecified limits on what knowledge is 'valid', how it should be made, or what 'types' of knowledge can be combined with each other.

The sixth and final verse is a statement of my ethical and political position, anarchism. Anarchism is a complex network of traditions and values, and it would be impossible to give an adequate summary of the majority of anarchist thought in a single paragraph. For myself, the nutshell of anarchism is that freedom and equality are intimately linked; that authority creates inequality by enabling some people to limit the freedom of others; and that a freer and more egalitarian society is possible by replacing authoritarian systems with decentralised networks of mutual aid. Myrmecodia is a genus of plants which live in a rich web of symbiotic associations. First, they are epiphytes, growing on the surface of other plants and gathering their nutrients from the air, no parasitism involved. Second, they are myrmecophytes, and live mutualistically with one or more colonies of ants. Internally, myrmecophytes contain chambers and passageways in which ants live and commute. These structures are rhizomic, another nod to Deleuze and Guattari. As ants are eusocial and each involved in relations of mutual care with both other ants, and the colony as a whole (a relation) in addition to the plant itself, the Myrmecodia is an ideal metaphor for uniting all of the concepts I have raised in the preceding verses, and demonstrating how they feed into a postmodern anarchism via an ethic of care. I make my only use of the plural "us" in this verse to emphasise this multiplicity and relationality I intend with this image. The line break between "feeding the plant as it / shelters us from harm" is to further emphasise this mutual relationship. On the fourth line I separate care and authority with a full stop, as "care. Authority", and capitalise authority. The difference in capitalisation symbolises the way that authority overrides and diminishes care, and the full stop serves as a boundary between authority and care, representing my view about their ultimate incompatibility. I define authority through its negative effect on multiplicity, and I align "suppression" with "undesirable" and "rejection" with "unworkable" to demonstrate the dual nature of the problem. Not only is the suppression of mutuality morally wrong, it is also impractical, because I take multiplicity as a given, and that means that authority will never be capable of meeting the needs of all, and will always eventually fall apart. I conclude with a terser definition of anarchism which throws this rejection back in authority's face.
