* Our lives are a series of experiences
* These experiences are complex, irreducible
* Experiences happen within situations: situations are the media of our lives
* Situations consist of many interlinked factors, some of which are unique to a particular experience, or us, or may be shared with other people and appear in and affect other people's stories
* What are stories?
  * Are they the experiences themselves, or what is left of them after they are gone, or representations of experiences, or artefacts that are generated from our experiences?
    * These are all interesting and useful but we need to disambiguate. We are creating an ontology of human experience, a phenomenology. Maybe look if other scholars have already disambiguated these.
  * Stories are sequences of events occurring within a particular (but not necessarily static) situation
    * Every event is only one (the actual) of many possibilities
    * Can visualise in 2D, time runs left to right, and the story is a sequence of events. Along top to bottom are all the different possibilities, from which one is actualised. The story is a thread which ties the actualities.
* Telling and retelling our stories allows us to remember, reflect on, and share our experiences
* We can analyse stories to understand how they are affected by different factors of their situation
  * Factors may cause, enable, limit, prevent, ... different events within our stories
    * Can we think of situations as (among other things) setting the probabilities of each possible event within a story?
  * Factors also affect each other
* Stories (and the events inside them) are not neutral, rather there are certain things we want to happen to us, to experience, and other things we want to avoid
* Situations both enable and constrain our stories: we cannot exist without situations, but our agency is also limited by them
* Public services/policies/... are designed to produce particular stories in the lives of their users/subjects/...
* However, not everybody wants the same story, and every user story is also influenced by other aspects of the situation (both the individual and the service) which sit outside of the service itself
* The best world is one where every person is able to live the story they want, fully exercising their agency, situations acting as purely enabling media with no constraints
* We can use collections of stories as tools to bring people together, understand how situations affect them, imagine something better, and plan how to change the situation to achieve that
* Every story is valid, they cannot be generalised to speak for other people. Representation is a lie.
* The social world necessarily involves living with, being affected by, and affecting other people
* How do we achieve the best world when this is the case?
  * We want people to consent to being affected by each other
  * We want to avoid both the total 'quantity' of constraints, and any inequalities in constraints (the latter is more important, because if everyone is equal then they can act in solidarity!)
  * Any constraints should be developed and adopted voluntarily and collectively (and individually, free association is the link?)
* We make assumptions about stories and situations all the time, both ours and other peoples
  * We need to stop this
    * Can (some) research be conceived as the desire to accurately describe the situation and the linkages between situations and events?
* "Many Stories": many possible, many people, each of us has many, we want to make more possible






non representational research, situated, rejecting the abstract and the general. every story is valid and unique

primacy of individual experience
contingent on the situation, situation is media for stories and experiencrs
storirs are ontological, thry are renderings of experiences
oppression, domination, authority, are violations of consent. consent is our autonomy and control of our own experinces and stories.
not trying to increase the capacity for variety, but challenging the underlying logic
against assumption, generalisation, abstraction. rejecting 'science' and unsituated knowledge
vibing with Butler. What's the praxis?
researcher as a way of being, naivete
how do we act on stories? how do we use them?
we have to elicit them, tell them, listen to them, connect emotionally with them and the people in them, share them, understand them, explain them, why they happened, and then take relevant action to change the situations which mediated them
should be simple enough to explain at 9 yo reading level
anarchism is about consent insofar as it is about shifting authorship to those who experience, allowing them to choose how the situation affects them, being able to use it as a free and open and unconstrained medium
