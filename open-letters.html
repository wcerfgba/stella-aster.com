<blockquote>
<p>celebrating the scholarly letter, because that is how scholarship may
be done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A journal specialising in the reproduction of meaningful
correspondence, <em>Open Letters</em> publishes copies of letters which
have already been sent.</p>
<p><strong>Volume 1 is open for submissions until Friday 31st January
2025</strong></p>
<p>We believe that dialogue, ‚Äúliterary work consisting of a conversation
between two or more persons‚Äù<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> , is a powerful way to
make and share knowledge. Many of us know its ubiquity, as we spend so
much of our lives in our inboxes and WhatsApps. Some of us also know of
the different privileges afforded to different forms of media and
dialogue: the newspapers are different to the Discord server is
different to the academic journals are different to my emails with
colleagues are different to our chats down the pub. We believe that all
of these forms of conversation provide different and valid ways of
making and sharing understanding. Recording and sharing conversations
more widely opens those conversations to more people, along with the
knowledges and understandings transmitted through them. We believe that
is can be a Good Thing.</p>
<p>We accept both open letters and private correspondence (with the
permission of all authors). Some valid formats include: postal and
electronic mail, direct messages and group chats on digital platforms,
and transcripts and recordings of relational interviews<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> .
We are open to other formats which are not on this list, don‚Äôt be shy üòä
We currently accept only submissions in English as that is the only
natural language the editor knows.</p>
<p><em>Open Letters</em> is created and edited by Stella Aster<a

role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, an artist, social researcher, and
activist from Leyland, Central Lancashire. She reserves the right to
make editorial decisions about what will and won‚Äôt be published for any
reason, until we can produce proper editorial guidelines.</p>
