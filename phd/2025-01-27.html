<p>Thinking about this move to Obsidian, and wanting to have a ‘live’
thesis online which also serves as the project website. What is this?
How do I structure it? I hadn’t even thought that I need to give it a
name! What actually… is this? It’s my thesis. But it’s also End Weight
Stigma Central Lancashire. I’ve been thinking about it for so long as an
activist thing, with activist aesthetics and outcomes, that it no longer
makes sense to do that. And in seeing this, I see one of the central
ethical contradictions that I have faced on this journey, of trying to
distance myself from a creation to which I feel like I can only be the
facilitator. At some point, this is going to become bigger than me, or
at least that’s what I envision. I think I need to find a way to
separate the research and activist effects. What I want here is a
research project which enables or achieves activist outcomes, not an
‘activist research’ project, because I am not a fat activist. I don’t
feel I can be, because I lack the lived experience, because I am an
outsider. Instead, I need to see this as my own personal enquiry, which
cannot achieve liberation by itself, and which lacks the ecosystem
around it to achieve liberation, and so it must aim to build the
capacity for and the possibility of liberation.</p>
<p>Who do I want to read this? Who is the intended audience?
Participants will want to ‘analyse’ data, and read and discuss the
findings. The findings should be public. My supervisors need the juicy
academic thesis chapters. I need to manage tons of qualitative data in
the most effective way possible. Some data is confidential.</p>
<p>What are some principles I can use to achieve all this?</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>The homepage, <a
href="Central%20Lancashire%20End%20Weight%20Stigma.html">Central
Lancashire End Weight Stigma</a>, needs to have a small number of entry
points which will appeal to different audiences/users.</li>
<li>People read and use this thesis by moving around it. Therefore the
structure of the web should facilitate movement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Immediately I slip back to structure. Here’s another question: what
do I call it, and what will its URL be?</p>
<p>Maybe I need to put some structure on it first, following those
principles, and then it will become clearer.</p>
<hr />
<p>I’ve cracked it. It ties in with my broader Central Lancashire work,
and I’m caretaking it for now. As I do so, I’m following a particular
process, some of which I can document here, and part of which includes a
commitment to open research, and making the process visible, which is
possible through this iterative, living, publication format.</p>
<p>I realise now that I wasn’t ready for this PhD when I started it. I
had to change in order to find it. That’s why it was so hard, and so
long.</p>
