</header>
<p>Weight stigma is when people are judged by their weight and
subsequently hurt by these judgements. For example, some people feel
they cannot eat in public because they will get dirty looks. Other
people may not go see their doctor when they are ill, because they worry
that theyâ€™ll just get told to lose weight.</p>
<p>The Central Lancashire End Weight Stigma project exists to dismantle
weight stigma within healthcare in Central Lancashire.</p>

correct health inequalities.</p>

<h2 id="our-process">Our process</h2>
<p>We are currently looking for people who have experienced weight
stigma in Central Lancashire to talk to us about their experiences.
Participants will be interviewed by Stella, and these interviews will be
transcribed and made available on this website.</p>
<p>As we start to collect information about different peopleâ€™s
experiences of weight stigma, we will be able to understand how weight
stigma presents itself, and what causes it. We will also be able to look
at ways we can heal and protect ourselves from weight stigma, and ways
we can dismantle it.</p>
<p>Everyone is invited to read the experiences we are collecting here,
and to share their thoughts with us. If we want to understand weight
stigma, we need to look for patterns, questions, and whatâ€™s missing.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-contribute">How to contribute</h2>
<p>If you would like to contribute to the project in any way, please
contact Stella Aster at endweightstigma@stella-aster.com. We are
particularly interested in hearing directly from people with a lived
experience of weight stigma.</p>
