# Prefigurative fiction

> By “prefigurative fiction,” then, I mean a form of writing that does not merely map out radical tomorrows in advance. Instead, it is fiction that opens up futures in the present as spaces of reflection and growth, of hope and possibility and, most importantly, as spaces where “the human” might be otherwise, spaces of the radical imagination. Prefigurative fiction is distinct from other forms of science fiction or utopian literature in its modesty when it comes to its prognostications and in its modeling of a radical form of authoriality, one that does not seek to impress the egoistic stamp of the author upon the descried future but, instead, rejects author- ity even as it exists within a form (the novel) where authoriality is (seemingly) compulsory. Just as prefigurative politics plant and tend the seeds of a better tomorrow in the poisoned soil of today, so too does prefigurative fiction hint towards another, post-revolutionary form of “culture” from within today’s authoritarian form of the novel. Like prefigurative politics, prefigurative fiction isn’t perfect and is always muddy, confused, learning, making mistakes, and “getting called” on it. But both are built on a radical unending “humanism” and a profound but never simple love and optimism. It is this critical optimism that marks prefigurative fiction from other acts of speculative fiction, even when it is avowedly dystopia
