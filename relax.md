Looking for a lover:
is it a strain or is it relaxing?
I want to do it, there is something enjoyable in the labour, the search.
But it makes my heart ache, with the gentle timid steps, the trepidations.

Downtime is different:
gentle warmth sinking into my bones;
the slow release of tension, stepped and asymptotic.

How do you practice non-action?
"Have you ever tried to relax? It is a paradox!"
Perhaps it is grounded in being, not doing?
But we are always both, so what is the difference?

Are we, before we do? Not if "[you] think, therefore [you are]".
And what of becoming, which is being doing?

Is this writing relaxing, or is it effort?
Are they mutually exclusive?
Often I feel better when I write, it is a catharsis,
but sometimes we need to stop.
