Saline beads out of my skin and struggles to evaporate into the humid air. I feel sticky, warm. I look down at my hand, pink with dilated capillaries.

"How do you feel?"

The voice is bassy, but does not reverberate. It sounds like it could be coming from anywhere.

I step through my thought process slowly. I parse the words and let answers slowly come to the surface of my mind, but they struggle to adhere together.

"... hot..."

I time the word with my slow breaths. The hot water in the air makes it feel like I am not breathing. The surfaces of my airways have been removed and my lungs and the air are a single substance.

"Close your eyes."

I do as the voice commands, and some of the droplets of moisture on my eyelids merge together and roll downwards under their combined weight.

"How do you feel?"

"... My skin is hot, warm... and wet... It's hard to think..."

"How is it hard to think?"

"... Slow..."

I am unable to remember how I got here, or why I am here, or who the voice is, or why they are asking me these questions. My brow tightens slightly as I try to engage the confusion in my overheated state.

"What are you thinking?"

I'm uncertain if they are responding to the change in my facial expression or merely continuing with their line of questioning.

"I don't know... why I am here..."

I answer sincerely before my self-preservation instincts start to kick in. Has this person brought me here? Can I leave?
