Now that I'm writing, what do I do with it? Should I be publishing these things? I am publishing these things, at least to make them more accessible to myself. I definitely want to publish my "personal statement", that's what started this. I suppose partly it depends on the purpose of why I want to publish what I want to publish, and that will direct where I should publish it for the sorts of effects and affects I want.

When do I publish? Or rather, when do I ask myself if I think I should publish each particular thing? Asking the question feels like a death, a finalisation, a limiting of a thing to its actualities, the removal of all further potential. But this ignores the acts of witnessing, consuming, interpreting, which are themselves only opened up when the thing is published and shared. One of the central challenges of artisanal artistry is balancing the different desires: to explore potential and create; to accept and let be; to let go and unleash.
