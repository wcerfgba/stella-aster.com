# The Impossibility of Authority

Authority is obsessed with control
Many of the 'crises' we see today are crises of control, failure to steer complex systems
Authority is borne out of a desire to control. That desire to control may be motivated by other desires and fears: a wish to avoid harmful outcomes and scenarios; a need for stability or certainty; ...
Authority is an attempt to control from the top down. It assumes a centralisation of knowledge about a system. This is impossible because the components of complex systems generate data at a rate faster than it can be transferred and processed by other parts of the system. The State is always attempting to consolidate data and computational capacity.
A bottom up view is completely different. It asks: how can we enable control 'at the edge', within each component, without the need for centralisation of information or decision-making power?
In the long run, an ideal authority is impossible, for two reasons. First, there will always be parts of the system which can't be controlled, or even observed, through the eye of the State. Every person and collective contains untapped potential for action, which can be used to circumvent State apparatus. Second, because the volume of information which the State can store and process is limited -- much below the actuality of modern societies, let alone their potentials --, any mechanism of control developed by the state will only be able to handle a limited variety of scenarios.
