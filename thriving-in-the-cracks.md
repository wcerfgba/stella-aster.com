I want something that's evocative and pragmatic, something that gets people inspired to do X and shows them how it can be done, reducing friction, lubricating.

That might include telling stories of where resistance and conviviality are already happening. A recipe from a FNB group. A photo or story of a protest.

It could also be speculative, or new calls to action, things we want to do but don't have the time, courage, or other resources to do.

The process should have some relationality and conviviality involved in it as well. This is a group project, an example of thriving in the cracks itself. It needs to make us, the resistance, stronger. So perhaps we do submissions, then meeting and sharing and connecting and discussing and doing, and then document that, and then publish it all as a website and book.
